# Reproduce DrBC model

The goal of the homework is to reproduce the paper [Learning to Identify High Betweenness Centrality Nodes from Scratch: A Novel Graph Neural Network Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10418) (as much as possible).
This [DrBC.ipynb](https://github.com/Lin-chia6/MLG_hw1_DrBC/blob/main/DrBC.ipynb) is followed by paper and based on [emschenn/mlg-hw1](https://github.com/emschenn/mlg-hw1/blob/master/DrBC.ipynb).

## Description of homework1 dataset

There are two datasets in hw1_data.zip file, including a Synthetic data and a real world data.

### File format
1. "number".txt contains the edge list of a graph. (i.e. node1 node2)
2. "number"_score.txt contains the exact BC value of each node.

### Synthetic data
1. The data are generated by networkx package with  powerlaw_cluster_graph function.(n=5000, m=4, p=0.05)
2. In hw1_data/Synthetic/5000 folder, there are 30 generated graphs and the exact BC value of each graph.
3. You need to report the averaged metrics with these 30 graphs.

### Real world data
The com-youtue data includes the social network which the author used in the paper.
